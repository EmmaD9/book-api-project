What work is left and the plan to complete it:
    dfd

Above and Beyond Plan:
    Good ui styling, ability to search/add books from another api?

Borrowed code fragments:
    I used a lot of the HTTP API 2 homework as a reference, specifically ./responses, and server.js, and I marked in my code where I used them and what they were used for. Essentially I used it as a base to get my api server started
